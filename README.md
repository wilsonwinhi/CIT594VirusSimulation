# CIT594VirusSimulation

The goal of the application is to perform simulation of a spreading process of a fatal virus within a network.  Such simulation can be of great value when applied to fields like public health and information security.
In addition to the spread simulation, the simulation also takes intervention process into consideration. Through simulation, the application can help to develop the a strategy which can effectively and efficiently slow down the spreading and eventually prevent the virus from further spreading.
