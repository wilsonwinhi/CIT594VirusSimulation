# CIT594VirusSimulation

The goal of the application is to perform simulation of a spreading process of a fatal virus within a network.  Such simulation can be of great value when applied to fields like public health and information security.
In addition to the spread simulation, the simulation also takes intervention process into consideration. Through simulation, the application can help to develop the a strategy which can effectively and efficiently slow down the spreading and eventually prevent the virus from further spreading.

## Description of the problem
	The whole process is composed of steps as followed:
a.	Network Establishment
b.	Virus Parameter Setting
c.	Infective Object Parameter Setting
d.	Early Stage of Spreading (without intervention)
e.	Intervention Strategy Development
f.	Simaltanious Simulation of Spreading Process and Intervention Strategy
g.	Result and Conclusion
